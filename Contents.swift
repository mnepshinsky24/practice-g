//Intention: I would like to create a piece of code that would take each scholar's name and output each name into a string
//Data Types involved: Strings
//var name = "Sabyatha"
//var name2 = "Nailah"
//
//print("Hi \(name)" + " and " + "\(name2)! We are so happy you're here at KWK Portland!")

//Intention: Working with integers and doubles
//Data Types: Ints and Doubles

//var int = 4
//var double = 5.0
//
//print(Double(int) * double)

var a = 12.4
var b = 65.0
var c = 31.0
var d = 98

print(((a+b+c)+Double(d))/4)
